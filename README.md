# Final Year Project

I've put relevant sections of my final year project on Github for several reasons - ease of sharing with others, and synchronising projects across different machines. Sections are named this way because trying to repeatedly type '1D-MacCormack-Solver_ver2' into a terminal is a nightmare.

## ernie

This solves a quasi-1D system of Euler equations using a MacCormack predictor-corrector solver, written in Fortran. Output 'solution.plt' is ASCII text, formatted for Tecplot. At the time of writing, I'm not sure it actually works.
