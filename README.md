# Final Year Project

I've put relevant sections of my final year project on Github for several reasons - mainly ease of sharing with others and synchronising projects across different machines. Sections are named this way because trying to repeatedly type '1D-MacCormack-Solver_ver2' into a terminal is a nightmare.

## ernie

This solves a quasi-1D system of Euler equations using a MacCormack predictor-corrector solver, written in Fortran. Output 'solution.plt' is ASCII text, formatted for Tecplot.

## frances

This directory acts a testing box for functions.

## harold

Beta version of full adjoint code.

## ivan

First full working adjoint code. This outputs the sensitivity a pressure integral with respect to the duct throat ratio.

## james

Development of a 2D JST scheme for a nozzle.
